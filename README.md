In this project, you will design and implement a database for a library management system. You will got through 3 phases, 1st is to create an ER schema diagram, phase 2 implement it in SQL and finally in phase 3 to create queries and a GUI application of the Library Management System company.

Assume the following requirements were collected for the database application:

    The database keeps track of BOOKs. Each Book has a unique IdNo (assume this is a unique integer generated by the system for each new BOOK such as 1, 2, 3, …), a title (assume this is a string, such as “The mind of the leader” or “Atomic Habits”), an author, and a publishers name (also a string).
    Each PUBLISHER has a phone number and an address associated with it.
    In this system there are several LIBRARY_BRANCHES, each branch has a unique Id, a name, and an address.
    There are multiple BOOK_COPIES of every BOOK at different LIBRARY_BRANCHES.
    The Library Management System also keeps track of BORROWERs of BOOKs, each BORROWER has a card, name, address, and phone number.
    BORROWERs can borrow BOOKs from any LIBRARY_BRANCH. The Library Management System keeps track of the BOOKs’ date checked out and the return date and if the book has been returned.
